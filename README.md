# Fish Swarm Simulation 🐟🌊

Welcome to the **Fish Swarm Simulation**! This is a **fun and interactive project** that simulates a school of fish swimming in a body of water, with bubbles rising to the surface and bread pieces being dropped into the water. It's also a great way to **experiment and play** with code while learning **JavaScript** and explore creative coding using **p5.js**.

## Features ✨
- **Fish Swarm**: A group of fish swims around, following simple flocking rules.
- **Bubbles**: Bubbles rise from the bottom and pop at the surface, creating ripples.
- **Bread Interaction**: Drop bread into the water, and the nearby fish will swarm toward it.
- **Ripple Effects**: Bubbles and bread create ripples when they interact with the water surface.
